				<p>
					Dear potential portfolio viewer, <br/>
					Hi! My name is Jordan Gottlieb. I am a senior at Dr. 
					Michael Krop Senior High School. As a part of my school's
					student government, I got involved in an organization called 
					Peace Jam, which helps to combat injustices in the world today. 
					One of these injustices is gender-based inequality.
					This is what brought me to Girls Who Code! I am prove that women are 
					capable of anything! Here is my portfolio of computer science programs 
					I have worked on throughout my Girls Who Code journey!
